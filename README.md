# My CSC256 Repository

This repository is for my CSC256 course work. I’ll be using it to store assignments, projects, and any practice code that I write as I learn Python and software development. It’s also where I’ll practice using Git and GitHub for version control.

## About Me

I’m currently a student working on my degree in Information Technology: Computer Programming and Development. I have experience with Python, Java, and JavaScript, and I’m now learning more about software testing, version control, and working in a professional development environment.

## Goals for This Repository

My goal is to keep this repository well-organized and professional. Over time, I plan to add more detailed documentation, example programs, and notes that show my progress throughout the course. This will also serve as a portfolio piece I can show when I apply for internships or jobs.
